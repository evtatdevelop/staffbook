Problems:

1.  node-sass (node <= 17)

2.  One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
    declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
    node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.
